Title Four: Execution of Custodial Sentences and Custodial Measures Art. 74 1. Principles The human dignity of the prison inmates or of the inmates of an insti- tution for the execution of measures must be respected. Their rights may only be limited to the extent that that is required for the deprivation of their liberty and their co-existence in the penal institution. Art. 75 2. Execution of custodial sen- tences Principles 1 The execution of sentences must encourage an improvement in the social behaviour of the prison inmates, and in particular their ability to live their lives without offending again. The conditions under which sentences are executed must correspond as far as possible with those of normal life, guarantee the supervision of the prison inmates, counteract the harmful consequences of the deprivation of liberty and take appro- priate account of the need to protect the general public, the institution staff and other inmates. 2 ...116 3 The institution rules shall provide that a sentence management plan be drawn up in consultation with the prison inmate.
